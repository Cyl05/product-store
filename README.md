Basic PERN app I made to understand how to connect React front-end to back-end server with Postgres database and have multiple pages.

Made using Chakra UI library

## To use:

- run `touch .env` in root and configure environment variables:
    - PG_USER
    - PG_HOST
    - PG_PASSWORD
    - PG_PORT
    - PG_DATABASE
    - PORT
- run `npm run build` in root directory
- run `npm run start`, the site will be live at the port you specified (or http://localhost:3000)
